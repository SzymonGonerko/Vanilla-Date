Vanilla-Date is dating application in mobile version, fully functional, written in a React library
, styled with JSS and with Material-UI. During write a project, I learned how to apply functions
asynychronical and solve the problem of server queries. I became proficient in
reading documentation and managing component lifecycles. App
placed on a Google server (Firebase) along with user authentication and service
backend. Design inspired by the movie "The Shape of Water" dir. Guillermo del Toro

1. Material-UI and MaterialUI/core

One of the most commonly used NPM packages were Material-UI and MaterialUI / core. I decided to install both. The design of the MaterialUI / core components is more suited to the form and the Material-UI components are more suited to the user section (for example UserCard.js). One of the problems with styling Material components is that the vast majority of them can only be styled linearly. The Material components are based on their own classes, so class styling is much more difficult. Therefore, in some parts of the project, I  use linear styling and class styling for html tags.

2. Friebase-9.6.8
