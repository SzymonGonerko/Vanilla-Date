Vanilla-Date is dating application in mobile version, fully functional, written in a React library
, styled with JSS and with Material-UI. During write a project, I learned how to apply functions
asynychronical and solve the problem of server queries. I became proficient in
reading documentation and managing component lifecycles. App
placed on a Google server (Firebase) along with user authentication and service
backend. Design inspired by the movie "The Shape of Water" dir. Guillermo del Toro
